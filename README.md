This repository contains a Spring Boot application that tracks the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) globally and by country. The application retrieves data from an API and displays it in a web page using Thymeleaf. The data includes the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as the percentage change over the previous day. The application also allows users to search for specific countries and view the data for a particular date range. This project was developed as a learning exercise and demonstrates my skills in Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and API integration.
